- source_image: the reference image for generation, should be square and max 512x512.
- driving_video: the driving video containing a face, should match the resolution of the source_image and max 512x512.
- seed: controls current generation seed
- ddim_steps: how many samples (steps) for generating the output. Diminishing returns after 15.
- best_frame: which frame of the driving_video most closely matches the source_image.

## üñ•Ô∏è Custom Environment
I created a custom ComfyUI environment for testing out X-Portrait nodes:

**akatzai/comfy-env-xportrait:0.0.1**

Create a new environment and copy and paste the link above into the "Custom Image" field in my Environment Manager tool:
